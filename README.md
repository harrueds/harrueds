## About me

- Strong background in **mathematics and applied statistics**, with experience building and evaluating predictive models.
- Daily **Linux user for 10+ years** (Debian-based systems), comfortable with development, scripting, and system-level tooling.
- Experience developing **Machine Learning APIs** and containerized services using **Flask, Docker, and GitHub Actions**.
- Focus on **reproducible ML projects** using modern Python tooling (`src/` layout, dependency locking, CI pipelines).
- Programming experience in **Python** (primary) and **C**.
- Former mathematics teacher, with experience explaining complex concepts clearly and rigorously — a skill now applied to documentation and technical communication.

- Model evaluation and validation
- Separation of training and inference pipelines
- API-based model serving
- Reproducible environments (`pyproject.toml`, lock files)
- CI/CD with **GitHub Actions**

### Backend & Deployment
- Flask (ML APIs)
- Docker & Docker Hub
- Basic REST API design
- Linux-based deployment workflows

### Systems & Environment
- Linux (Debian, Ubuntu)
- Bash, CLI tooling
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code
